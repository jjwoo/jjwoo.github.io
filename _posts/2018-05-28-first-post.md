# Life After Data Science Course

Phew! I heaved a sigh of relief mentally, as I collected my certificate of completion from my course instructor.
It was the last day of the 12-week bootcamp in data science, and it had a bittersweet feel to it. It was a fruitful 12-week 
spent learning data science from scratch with coursemates from all walks of life. Most of us are looking to switch careers,
some are still students, but all with one objective: To emerge as competent data scientists/analysts equipped with the relevant
skillsets.

## Am I Competent Already?

As I stand on the cusp of being a newly minted data analyst, I cannot help but wonder whether I am fully ready for the challenges ahead.
12 weeks of mind-boggling learning have definitely brought me from a data newbie to a... junior data scientist/analyst? Does it work that way?
One thing for sure, I am not the same person as I was before the start of the course. I have learnt and acquired skillsets
in Python, data preparation, statistical modelling, machine learning, SQL etc. But is that enough?

There is no way to fully answer that, and I expect this to be the same for most, if not all, who ply this trade. The only certain
way is to continue working hard, to continue perfecting our craft and knowledge in this ever-evolving industry.

## So What's Next?

I will continue to immerse myself in picking up new knowledge in data science, and also to come up with more creative projects 
to tinker with and offer a fresh perspective to all who visit my Github Pages.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you like what you see around here!
