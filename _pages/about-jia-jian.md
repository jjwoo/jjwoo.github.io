## Who Am I?
At my former workplace, I was introduced to Machine Learning when adopting preventive 
maintenance technology.

This led to an extensive reading up into the realm of Data Science. And I have never turned back since.

I am a python coder with skillsets in statistical modeling, machine learning techniques and SQL.

Armed with analytical mindset from engineering background, I am a firm believer that data is the new currency of tomorrow and its possibilities are boundless.


## When I Am Not Dabbling With Data Science, I..
* Conduct pro bono tuition for less privileged children
* Like to have interesting conversations over drinks
* Am an avid runner and football player
